# hello-world
Just another repository

This is my tutorial/testing repo. 

Now cloned to my local PC. :)

Here we have more info: more info.
And more coming from the local PC!

When we add changes to this file locally, we must add all modified files to staging area and then commit changes:

git add --all
git commit -m "Comment for all changes in this commit."
git push origin master


If a new branch is obsolete, it can be deleted (locally).
git branch -d my-branch-name
